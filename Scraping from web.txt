The What?

What exactly is web scraping or web mining or web harvesting? It is a technique for extracting data from websites. Remember, websites contain wealth of useful data but designed for human consumption and not data analysis. The goal of web scraping is to take advantage of the pattern or structure of web pages to extract and store data in a format suitable for data analysis.

The Why?

Now, let us understand why we may have to scrape data from the web. Data Format: As we said earlier, there is a wealth of data on websites but designed for human consumption. As such, we cannot use it for data analysis as it is not in a suitable format/shape/structure.
No copy/paste: We cannot copy & paste the data into a local file. Even if we do it, it will not be in the required format for data analysis. No save/download: There are no options to save/download the required data from the websites. We cannot right click and save or click on a download button to extract the required data. Automation: With web scraping, we can automate the process of data extraction/harvesting.

The How?

robots.txt: One of the most important and overlooked step is to check the robots.txt file to ensure that we have the  permission to access the web page without violating any terms or conditions. In R, we can do this using the robotstxt
by rOpenSci. Fetch: The next step is to fetch the web page using the xml2 package and store it so that we can extract the required data. Remember, you fetch the page once and store it to avoid fetching multiple times as it may lead to your IP address being blocked by the owners of the website. Extract/Store/Analyze: Now that we have fetched the web page, we will use rvest to extract the data and store it for further analysis.

Use Cases Below are few use cases of web scraping:

Contact Scraping: Locate contact information including email addresses,
phone numbers etc.
Monitoring/Comparing Prices: How your competitors price their products, how your prices fit within your industry, and whether there are any fluctuations that you can take advantage of.
Scraping Reviews/Ratings: Scrape reviews of product/services and use it for text mining/sentiment analysis etc.
Things to keep in mind…

Static & Well Structured: Web scraping is best suited for static & well structured web pages. In one of our case studies, we demonstrate how badly structured web pages can hamper data extraction.
Code Changes: The underling HTML code of a web page can change anytime due to changes in design or for updating details. In such case, your script will stop working. It is important to identify changes to the web page and modify the web scraping script accordingly.
API Availability: In many cases, an API (application programming interface) is made available by the service provider or organization. It is always advisable to use the API and avoid web scraping. The httr package has a nice introduction on interacting with APIs.
IP Blocking: Do not flood websites with requests as you run the risk of getting blocked. Have some time gap between request so that your IP address in not blocked from accessing the website. robots.txt: We cannot emphasize this enough, always review the robots.txt file to ensure you are not violating any terms and conditions.

Case Studies

IMDB top 50 movies: In this case study we will scrape the IMDB website to extract the title, year of release, certificate, runtime, genre, rating, votes and revenue of the top 50 movies.
Most visited websites: In this case study, we will look at the 50 most visited websites in the world including the category to which they belong, average time on site, average pages browsed per vist and bounce rate.
List of RBI governors : In this final case study, we will scrape the list of RBI Governors from Wikipedia, and analyze the background from which they came i.e whether there were more economists or bureaucrats?


HTML Basics
To be able to scrape data from websites, we need to understand how the web
pages are structured. In this section, we will learn just enough HTML to be
able to start scraping data from websites.

HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT

A web page typically is made up of the following:
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) takes care of the content. You need to have a basic knowledge of HTML tags as the content is located with these tags. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) takes care of the appearance of the content. While you don’t need to look into the CSS of a web page, you should be able to identify the id or class that manage the appearance of content.
JS (Javascript) takes care of the behavior of the web page.

HTML Element

HTML element consists of a start tag and end tag with content inserted in between. They can be nested and are case insensitive. The tags can have attributes as shown in the above image. The attributes usually come as name/value pairs. In the above image, class is the attribute name while primary is the attribute value. While scraping data from websites in the
case study, we will use a combination of HTML tags and attributes to locate the content we want to extract. Below is a list of basic and important HTML tags you should know before you get started with web scraping.

DOM

DOM (Document Object Model) defines the logical structure of a document and the way it is accessed and manipulated. In the above image, you can see that HTML is structured as a tree and you trace path to any node or tag. We will use a similar approach in our case studies. We will try to trace the content we intend to extract using HTML tags and attributes. If the web page is well structured, we should be able to locate the content using a unique combination of tags and attributes.

HTML Attributes

all HTML elements can have attributes they provide additional information about an element they are always specified in the start tag usually come in name/value pairs The class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with same
class name. HTML elements with same class name will have the same format and style. The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. It can be used on any HTML element and is case sensitive. The style attribute sets the style of an HTML element.

Libraries
We will use the following R packages in this tutorial.

library(robotstxt)
library(rvest)
library(selectr)
library(xml2)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(tibble)
library(purrr)

MDB Top 50

In this case study, we will extract the following details of the top 50 movies
from the IMDB website:

title
year of release
certificate
runtime
genre
rating
votes
revenue
robotstxt
Let us check if we can scrape the data from the website using paths_allowed()
from robotstxt package.

paths_allowed(
  paths = c("https://www.imdb.com/search/title?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating")
)
## 
 www.imdb.com                      No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.
## [1] TRUE
Since it has returned TRUE, we will go ahead and download the web page using
read_html() from xml2 package.

imdb <- read_html("https://www.imdb.com/search/title?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating")
imdb
## {xml_document}
## 
## [1] \n\n\n            
Title


As we did in the previous case study, we will look at the HTML code of the IMDB

web page and locate the title of the movies in the following way:



hyperlink inside 
 tag

section identified with the class .lister-item-content


In other words, the title of the movie is inside a hyperlink () which

is inside a level 3 heading (

) within a section identified by the class

.lister-item-content.

Year of Release

The year in which a movie was released can be located in the following way:

tag identified by the class .lister-item-year
nested inside a level 3 heading (
)
part of section identified by the class .lister-item-content
imdb %>%
  html_nodes(".lister-item-content h3 .lister-item-year") %>%
  html_text() 
##  [1] "(1994)" "(1972)" "(2008)" "(1974)" "(2003)" "(1994)" "(1993)"
##  [8] "(1966)" "(1957)" "(2010)" "(1999)" "(2001)" "(1994)" "(2002)"
## [15] "(1999)" "(1990)" "(1980)" "(1975)" "(1954)" "(2014)" "(2002)"

## [43] "(1998)" "(1994)" "(1991)" "(1988)" "(1988)" "(1985)" "(1981)"
## [50] "(1979)"
If you look at the output, the year is enclosed in round brackets and is a
character vector. We need to do 2 things now:

remove the round bracket
convert year to class Date instead of character
We will use str_sub() to extract the year and convert it to Date using
as.Date() with the format %Y. Finally, we use year() from lubridate
package to extract the year from the previous step.

## [43] "119 min" "88 min"  "137 min" "155 min" "89 min"  "116 min" "115 min"
## [50] "147 min"
If you look at the output, it includes the text min and is of type
character. We need to do 2 things here:

remove the text min
convert to type numeric
We will try the following:

use str_split() to split the result using space as a separator
extract the first element from the resulting list using map_chr()
use as.numeric() to convert to a number

Rating

The rating of the movie can be located in the following way:

part of the section identified by the class .ratings-imdb-rating
nested within the section identified by the class .ratings-bar
the rating is present within the tag as well as in the
data-value attribute
instead of using html_text(), we will use html_attr() to extract the
value of the attribute data-value
Try using html_text() and see what happens! You may include the tag
or the classes associated with tag as well.

convert it into a number.

XPATH

To extract votes from the web page, we will use a different technique. In this
case, we will use xpath and attributes to locate the total number of
votes received by the top 50 movies.

xpath is specified using the following:

tab
attribute name
attribute value
Votes

In case of votes, they are the following:

meta
itemprop
ratingCount
Next, we are not looking to extract text value as we did in the previous examples
using html_text(). Here, we need to extract the value assigned to the
content attribute within the tag using html_attr().

imdb %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = '//meta[@itemprop="ratingCount"]') %>% 
  html_attr('content') 
##  [1] "2072893" "1422292" "2038787" "987020"  "1475650" "1621033" "1074273"
##  [8] "615219"  "585562"  "1817393" "1658750" "1492209" "1589127" "1334563"

## [50] "542311"
Finally, we convert the votes to a number using as.numeric().

  html_attr('content') %>%

Revenue

We wanted to extract both revenue and votes without using xpath but the way
in which they are structured in the HTML code forced us to use xpath to
extract votes. If you look at the HTML code, both votes and revenue are located
inside the same tag with the same attribute name and value i.e. there is no
distinct way to identify either of them.

In case of revenue, the xpath details are as follows:

name
nv
Next, we will use html_text() to extract the revenue.

To extract the revenue as a number, we need to do some string hacking as
follows:

extract values that begin with $
omit missing values
convert values to character using as.character()
append NA where revenue is missing (rank 31 and 47)
remove $ and M
convert to number using as.numeric()

Let us arrange the data by number of days served. The Term in office column
contains this information but it also includes the text days. Let us split this
column into two columns, term and days, using separate() from tidyr and
then select the columns Officeholder and term and arrange it in descending
order using desc().

Backgrounds
What we are interested is in the background of the Governors? Use count()
from dplyr to look at the backgound of the Governors and the respective
counts.

## 8 Indian Audit and Accounts Service officer       1
## 9 Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer              1
Let us club some of the categories into Bureaucrats as they belong to the
Indian Administrative/Civil Services. The missing data will be renamed as No Info.
The category Career Reserve Bank of India officer is renamed as RBI Officer
to make it more concise.

profile %>%
  pull(Background) %>%
  fct_collapse(
    Bureaucrats = c("IAS officer", "ICS officer",
    "Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer",
    "Indian Audit and Accounts Service officer",
    "Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer"),
    `No Info` = c(""),
    `RBI Officer` = c("Career Reserve Bank of India officer")
  ) %>%
  fct_count() %>%
  rename(background = f, count = n) -> backgrounds

backgrounds
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   background  count
##          
## 1 No Info         1
## 2 Banker          2
## 3 RBI Officer     1
## 4 Economist       7
## 5 Bureaucrats    14
Hmmm.. So there were more bureaucrats than economists.
